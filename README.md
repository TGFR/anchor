# Anchor

Anchor is a e-commerce app that enables users to create and enroll in one-on-one classes. Group classes are great, but sometimes you need one-on-one attention. Like the apprenticeship system once prevalent in times past, Anchor lets you meet with someone expert in their field and gives you a rock-solid connection to the foundation of your subject.

Find classes to further your passions, or charge what your time is worth as a teacher.

Dive deep. Anchor.

## Usage
